## Project Description

My Health App is a fitness and wellness tracker where users can input their daily acivities to work towards their goals. This is a health app for users who want to focus on awareness of their health journey.

This app will include a backend database using MongoDB and Express.js and a frontend web application using Node.js and React.

## Team Responsibilities

Overall we want to work on this project as a team- step by step. We will split up Models/Compenents when working on the frontend or backend. But once we have working functionality we will split up 2 on CSS and 2 on JavaScript to move faster.

- Lauren- Create a model, work on CR routes, and one component. Working on JavaScript functions at the end.
- Anju- Create a model, work on CR routes, and one component. Working on CSS and Responsive Design at the end.
- Rebecca- Create a model, work on UD routes, and one component. Working on JavaScript functions at the end.
- Kae- Create a model, work on UD routes, and one component. Working on CSS and Responsive Design at the end.

## User Stories

The user of our app will check in daily- preferably at the end of their day- to submit their activities for the day. At the end of the week they will check their My Health Page to see aggragated data and how they are tracking to their goals. This app is a positive part of their day and they feel accomplished submitting their good decisions. Keeping a journal of your day to day activity is a great way to reinforce the positive impacts of a healthy lifestyle.

## Code Snippet

The below code was used to add a new activity to our person model.

```js
const putActivity = (activity) => {
  const activitiesCopy = [...allActivities];
  activitiesCopy.push(activity);
  let data = {
    activity: activitiesCopy,
  };
  let options = {
    method: "PUT",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
  };
  fetch(urlBase + "/person/" + personId, options)
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => console.log(data));
};
```
